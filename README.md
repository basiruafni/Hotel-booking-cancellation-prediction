## Overview
Data visualization is a powerful tools for data analytics because of the ability to turn large and unorganized data into  visual context through plots or graphs that gives clear idea of the information and makes it easier to identify trend, pattern and outlier. Data visualization can help delivering data in most efficient way possible. 

In recent years, data analytics have been adopted to many industries, including hospitality industry. To be able to adapt in competitive era, hospitality industry like hotel should be able to manage and analyze data to generate insightful business recommendation that can redefine the way hotel conduct business. Using data visualization can help company to identify which area need to be improved, which factors affect customers satisfaction, etc. 
Therefore in this paper we will analyze Hotel Business Performance using Data Visualization and applying Machine Learning models to data in use of prediction.
## Goal
The goal is to analyze hotel business performance using business metrics related to monthly booking amount, cancellation rate relation to stay duration and lead time. By these information, we can find patterns that will lead to business recommendation based on data.
## Tools
The tools are Python as programming language and libraries used are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. And Scikit-learn for implementing Machine Learning algorithms.
## Dataset
The dataset is using hotel bookings dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/urmilsojitra/hotel-booking-cancellation).
